## coauthorsip

A shiny app to uses the [coauthornetwork](https://github.com/cimentadaj/coauthornetwork) package to visualize author-coauthorship networks from Google Scholar. You can visit the app at https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/gs_coauthorship/

The app works fine locally but can't be deployed for some reason. The app is on stop until [this](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/1269) gets resolved.
